RimHUD is a UI mod that displays a detailed information about a selected character or creature. The HUD display is integrated into the inspect pane which can be resized to fit the additional information. Alternatively the HUD can a separate floating window and docked to any position on the screen.

Visual warnings will appear if a pawn has any life threatening conditions, has wounds that need tending or is close to a mental breakdown.
